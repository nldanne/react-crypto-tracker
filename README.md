### Crypto Ocean - React Crypto website
This project was built to learn more things about using an API to display dynamic content using React Js, while also giving me the opportunity to understand cryptocurrencies in general because the topic is very intruiging to me but I always felt it was too foreign of a concept to immerse myself into. Users can track and search for crypto coins and read more stats and information about them.


The cryptocurrency tracker can be found on [Netlify](https://crypto-ocean.netlify.app/)
